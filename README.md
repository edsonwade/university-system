## Class Diagram 📊
A comprehensive class diagram illustrating the relationships and attributes of each entity should be created.

## Sequence Diagram 🔄
Sequence diagrams should demonstrate the flow of interactions between entities and services for key functionalities such as adding a student or scheduling an appointment.

## Functional Requirements 📝
- The application should support CRUD operations for all entities.
- The application should provide search functionalities for students, teachers, and appointments.
- The application should list all entities and their relationships.

## Non-Functional Requirements 🚀
- **Performance:** The application should respond within 200ms for any request.
- **Security:** The application should protect user data and ensure secure access.
- **Maintainability:** The application should be easy to maintain and extend with new features.

## Order of Implementation 🛠️
1. Set up the Java project.
2. Implement entities and repositories for Student, Degree, Course, Teacher, Appointment, and Availability.
3. Implement the service layer for business logic.
4. Develop a console-based user interface.
5. Integrate the application with the PostgreSQL database.
6. Write unit and integration tests.
7. Create Dockerfile and docker-compose configuration.


## Database Choice and Schema
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- A well-defined schema should be designed to accommodate the entities and their relationships effectively.

## Testing 🧪

- Unit tests and integration tests ensure functionality and reliability.
- Use [testing framework] to run tests and verify system behavior.

## Deployment 🚀

- Deployment strategies (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes) for production environments.
- Configuration management and scaling considerations.

## Security 🔒

- Security measures implemented (e.g., HTTPS, input validation).
- Data protection and user authentication strategies.

## Performance ⚡

- Performance benchmarks and considerations.
- Optimization techniques implemented (e.g., caching, database indexing).

## Error Handling

The API follows standard HTTP status codes and includes error responses with detailed error messages in JSON format.

### HTTP Status Codes

- `200 OK`: Successful request
- `400 Bad Request`: Invalid request data
- `401 Unauthorized`: Unauthorized request (not used currently)
- `404 Not Found`: Resource not found
- `500 Internal Server Error`: Server error

## Endpoints 🚀

### REST API

The REST API endpoints allow interaction with the application:
